Fluent Syntax
=============

The :py:mod:`fluent.syntax` library is built for tooling around Fluent. It's
designed to parse, analyze, process, and serialize Fluent files.

The :py:mod:`fluent.syntax.ast` module implements ``Visitor`` and ``Transformer``
patterns, which are the recommended interfaces to be used in analysis and
post-processing of Fluent source files.
